    <h2 class="About Me">About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Camryn Hubbard and I'm from Cleveland, Ohio. Ohio is a place I am reluctant to claim as home with the current state of affairs, however, this city has gifted me with a drive and work ethic I strive to maintain in all facets of my life. I have brought this same drive to coding. I have always had a passion for technology but never really pulled the trigger. I even went to college for law, however, the COVID-19 pandemic changed my view on my entire life. It took me awhile to be able to support myself and this year, 2023, i was able to start my coding journey through CodeAcademy. This portfolio is my first attempt to put the foundations I've learned on CodeAcademy to the test.</p>

    <h2 class="Coding Journey">Coding Journey</h2>
    <!--Have to figure out whre you want to put the video in this section-->
    <p>So now that I've told you a little bit about myself, I can talk about my coding journey. Personally I don't feel like I've come a long way just yet. Too me there's so much still to learn in html, css, and of course javascript because I haven't even touched it yet. I am happy that I have the foundations to be able to create something like this, I just can't wait to able to do bigger and more complex projects. I'm getting ahead of myself though.</p>

    <h4><i>How did I even get to this path?</i></h4>
    <p>We talked a little about my history in the about me section but not in depth on how I ended up in tech. Prior to 2023 I went to Amherst College for a Bachelor's Degree in Law. When the pandemic hit, coming home and having to do classes that way really killed the passion I had for school. Even at a top tier college like Amherst, I felt as if the challenge was gone and that all the money my family had put towards this experience was null and void - and at that point I had lost the passion I had for law as well. Because of these feelings I decided to leave Amhert in late 2021. I spent the year 2022 searching for a new passion. I knew I would love to be in tech but didn't think that it would be an accessible field without a degreee in computer science. After awhile of bouncing between jobs and even UberEats driving, I stumbled upon software engineering. <br>Delving deeper into the field I found many influencers and normal people talking online about their ability to break into tech by self teaching themselves coding languages. After doing some research I figured that starting with the front-end would be my best bet to get my foot in the door of the industry. This is where you find me today, using CodeAcademy to give me the foundations of front-end engineering. I can tell that this is something I am perfect for - I work well under pressure, am highly creative and an execellent problem solver. I was not the only one who saw my potential as I now also work for a tech startup as the CEO's direct tech support and liason when talking to our developers. Working with CodeAcademy and getting an entry level position in tech, has shown me this is my true passion. This is something I can always be better at and that excites me. The ability to be forever growing in this field may be daunting to some but I find that challenge drives me to be the best. Even though there are people who have been doing this for years, I know one day I will be on thier level, trying to help out someone in my current state.</p>

          <td class="compatibility">My girlfriend and I one night were watching the tik toks we send to each other and came across this silly compatibility test. That sparked our curiosity and we proceeded to look for a compatibility test online. We were dumbfounded by the fact that the only compatibility test we found are one-sided. Meaning that one person takes the test and get their own results, mostly the test we found give you a profile of the type of person you are. Then you partner takes the same test to get their own results. These were okay, but we were looking for something two-sided. Where she would take the test and I would have to guess what her answers would be. Or even we both take the test and the test compares your answer and gives you a percentage of how compatible you two are. This is my goal, and I know it's a little more advacned as there has to be animation and scripts from javascript but I'm up for the challenge once I have the foundation.</td>
